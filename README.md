# Generative Tweets
This sample portfolio project uses ChatGPT to scaffold an app that leverages OpenAI, AWS Lambdas and the Twitter API to schedule generative tweets about any topic you desire. 

The cost of running this bot is a few pennies for a couple of runs per day.

Recommend using the `max_tokens` parameter with a value of 50 tokens or less to have tweets match the 280 character limit.

Requirements:
- Python 3.9 or higher
